# Python Projects Directory

## Upload Your Python Projects Here

This folder is designated for uploading Python projects. Please ensure the following guidelines are met when uploading your project:

### Guidelines:
1. **Folder Structure**: 
   - Ensure your project is contained within its own folder named after the project (e.g., `my_project/`).
   
2. **File Naming**: 
   - Use lowercase letters and underscores for Python filenames (e.g., `main.py`, `helper_functions.py`).
   
3. **Dependencies**: 
   - Include a `requirements.txt` file or a `Pipfile` with the necessary packages and versions.
   
4. **README File**:
   - Each project should have its own `README.md` file with instructions on how to install dependencies and run the project.

Thank you for uploading your projects here!

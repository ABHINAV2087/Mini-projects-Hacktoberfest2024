# C++ Projects Directory

## Upload Your C++ Projects Here

This folder is designated for uploading C++ projects. Please ensure the following guidelines are met when uploading your project:

### Guidelines:
1. **Folder Structure**: 
   - Ensure your project is contained within its own folder named after the project (e.g., `my_project/`).
   
2. **File Naming**: 
   - Use descriptive names for your C++ source and header files (e.g., `main.cpp`, `helper_functions.h`).
   
3. **Dependencies**: 
   - If your project has dependencies or libraries, include a `CMakeLists.txt` file or other build configuration files with clear instructions.

4. **README File**:
   - Each project should have its own `README.md` file with instructions on how to compile and run the project.

Thank you for uploading your projects here!

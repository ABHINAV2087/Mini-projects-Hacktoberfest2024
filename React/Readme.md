# React Projects Directory

## Upload Your React Projects Here

This folder is designated for uploading React projects. Please ensure the following guidelines are met when uploading your project:

### Guidelines:
1. **Folder Structure**: 
   - Ensure your project is contained within its own folder named after the project (e.g., `my_project/`).
   
2. **File Naming**: 
   - Use camelCase for component filenames (e.g., `App.js`, `HeaderComponent.js`).
   
3. **Dependencies**: 
   - Include a `package.json` file listing all dependencies, along with setup instructions.

4. **README File**:
   - Each project should have its own `README.md` file with instructions on how to install and run the project using `npm` or `yarn`.

Thank you for uploading your projects here!

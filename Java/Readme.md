# Java Projects Directory

## Upload Your Java Projects Here

This folder is designated for uploading Java projects. Please ensure the following guidelines are met when uploading your project:

### Guidelines:
1. **Folder Structure**: 
   - Ensure your project is contained within its own folder named after the project (e.g., `my_project/`).
   
2. **File Naming**: 
   - Use camelCase or PascalCase for Java class and file names (e.g., `Main.java`, `MyClass.java`).
   
3. **Dependencies**: 
   - If your project uses external libraries, include a `pom.xml` (for Maven) or `build.gradle` (for Gradle), along with setup instructions.

4. **README File**:
   - Each project should have its own `README.md` file with instructions on how to install, build, and run the project.

Thank you for uploading your projects here!

# HTML Projects Directory

## Upload Your HTML Projects Here

This folder is designated for uploading HTML projects. Please ensure the following guidelines are met when uploading your project:

### Guidelines:
1. **Folder Structure**: 
   - Ensure your project is contained within its own folder named after the project (e.g., `my_project/`).
   
2. **File Naming**: 
   - Use lowercase letters and hyphens for filenames (e.g., `index.html`, `about-us.html`).
   
3. **Dependencies**: 
   - If your project uses CSS or JavaScript, ensure they are included in appropriately named folders (e.g., `css/`, `js/`).

4. **README File**:
   - Each project should have its own `README.md` file with instructions on how to view the project in a browser.

Thank you for uploading your projects here!

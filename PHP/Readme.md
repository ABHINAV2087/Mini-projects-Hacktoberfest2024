# PHP Projects Directory

## Upload Your PHP Projects Here

This folder is designated for uploading PHP projects. Please ensure the following guidelines are met when uploading your project:

### Guidelines:
1. **Folder Structure**: 
   - Ensure your project is contained within its own folder named after the project (e.g., `my_project/`).
   
2. **File Naming**: 
   - Use lowercase letters and underscores (`_`) for filenames (e.g., `index.php`, `database_config.php`).
   
3. **Dependencies**: 
   - If your project has external dependencies, include a `composer.json` file or clear setup instructions.

4. **README File**:
   - Each project should have its own `README.md` file with instructions on how to install and run the project.

Thank you for uploading your projects here!
